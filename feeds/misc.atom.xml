What is the use of building an awesome website and no one to benefit from it?. Decision was made that we would publicize pnr.me in the following 4 sites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" title="hacker news"&gt;hackernews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://hackerstreet.in/" title="hacker street india"&gt;hackerstreet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/" title="reddit"&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://therodinhoods.com/" title="the rodinhoods"&gt;rodinhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a mix of successes and failures and here is how it all went&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hackernews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackernews need no introduction and we assumed that although the audience is highly US centric, there will be sizable amount of Indian audience who would be interested in pnr prediction. That assumption turned out to be entirely wrong and we got no up votes for the &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6633391" title="hackernews"&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hacker Street India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hackerstreet.in/" title="hacker street india"&gt;hackerstreet&lt;/a&gt; is a community of Indian entrepreneurs and technical enthusiasts with heavy influences from hackernews. Pnr prediction is a problem most of them have faced at least once and we got &lt;a href="http://hackerstreet.in/item?id=31093" title="hackerstreet feedback for pnr.me"&gt;amazing response&lt;/a&gt; both in terms of visits and feedback from Hackerstreet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reddit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were very confused about which sub reddit to use. Should we go for &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/india/" title="India"&gt;India sub reddit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/trains/" title="trains"&gt;trains sub reddit&lt;/a&gt;?. We finally decided to publicize in trains sub reddit, assuming that since our product had everything to do with trains, it should be the right place to publicize. We were wrong and we got more down votes than up votes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Rodinhoods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stumbled on a rodinhoods post about possibility of using &lt;a href="http://therodinhoods.com/forum/topics/site-for-checking-probability-for-getting-confirmed-train-ticket?xg_source=activity" title="probability of ticket getting confirmed"&gt;past data to predict pnr charting status&lt;/a&gt; while browsing for &lt;a href="http://pnr.me/predictor" title="pnr prediction"&gt;pnr prediction&lt;/a&gt;. We found the community to be active and were giving generally good feedback and hence we created a &lt;a href="http://therodinhoods.com/forum/topics/instantly-predict-final-charting-status-of-indian-railways" title="pnr prediction at rodinhoods"&gt;showcase post in rodinhoods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial response were good and our traffic data was showing a spike. But we were not prepared for traffic that would come after &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/rodinhood" title="Alok Rodinhood Kejriwal"&gt;Alok Rodinhood Kejriwal&lt;/a&gt; shared the post in his facebook page. we had a huge jump in traffic which caused an &lt;a href="http://blog.pnr.me/no-more-internal-service-error.html" title="How we solved internal service error"&gt;internal service error&lt;/a&gt; and we were offline for almost two hours. Unexpected but an amazing marketing win&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Traffic spike after alok shared" src="http://blog.pnr.me/images/traffic_alok.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October 29 and 30th spike is due to hackerstreet and November 6th spike is due to rodinhoods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always publicize it to the right audience. Do not rely on a minority audience as the chances that they will be able to up vote or discuss about your work is highly remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not post on sub reddits with very few audience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a close watch on errors. First impression could very well be the last one.&lt;/li&gt;

Here is a brief introduction to the problem and how we are trying to solve this problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian railways is the biggest mover of people and goods in India. The demand far exceeds supply and it is very usual for busy trains to have a waiting list of more than 500. The holders of these waiting list tickets do not have a right to board the train and will only get that privilege if some one with a confirmed ticket cancels his/her ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would you know whether your waiting list will get confirmed or not?. Simple answer is no, you cannot. But by looking at past data, one can predict with reasonable accuracy whether waiting list ticket will get confirmed or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pnr.me/predictor" title="pnr prediction"&gt;pnr prediction tool&lt;/a&gt; takes pnr number as input and tries to predict the ticket`s final charting status. The prediction tool works by looking at similar pnr numbers and how their waiting list changed over time. It uses this data to make a sufficiently &lt;a href="http://pnr.me/accuracy" title="prediction accuracy"&gt;accurate prediction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year indian railways generate around 750 crores as cancellation charges. Every 1 in 3 train tickets booked are cancelled. &lt;a href="http://pnr.me/" title="pnr.me"&gt;pnr.me&lt;/a&gt; hopes to reduce that number.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="introduction"></category><category term="pnr"></category></entry></feed>
